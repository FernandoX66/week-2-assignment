# To-do List and GitHub Profile

## How to use

* You can start using the project just by opening the index.html file. 
* You will find two pages on the website, the to-do list, and the GitHub profile project.
* On the to-do list page, you can add as many tasks as you want, and they will be stored on the local storage of your browser. 
* You can edit them, delete them, and filter them in many ways.
* On the GitHub profile page, you can type for a GitHub user, and if it exists, you will be able to see a lot of details about that user.

## Aditional information

* The user stars in the GitHub page were calculated with the length of the array that we can get fetching the starred URL.
* Both pages were done using ES6 classes and static methods for methods that don't depend on an instance of the Class.
